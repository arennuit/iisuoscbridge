NOTE: This software only runs on Windows.

1. Install iisu SDK 3.0 or a newer version.
2. Install IisuOscBridge 0.x or a newer version. Make sure you install iisuOscBridge after you install iisu itself.
3. Configure and calibrate iisu as normally (as explained in the iisu SDK documentation).
4. Run IisuOscBridge.
5. If anything goes in an unexpected way then check the iisu log files (in the iisu installation directory, not in the iisuOscBridge one) that could give you an hint on what is going on. This is because of a limit in how iisu handles its log and shall be overcome in a later version.

NOTE: if you re-install iisu and change its path then you need to re-install iisuOscBridge as well, or modify the 'Path' environment variable to reflect the new path for the iisu 'bin' directory.
